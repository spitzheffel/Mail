# Security Policy

Mail processes mailbox credentials and private email content. Deploy it as a security-sensitive application.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue containing credentials, tokens, private messages, exploit details, or personal data. Contact the repository maintainer privately and include only the minimum reproduction information required.

## Deployment requirements

- Use HTTPS through a trusted reverse proxy.
- Complete the one-time administrator setup immediately after first deployment, before exposing the instance on a public network. First-run setup trusts whoever can reach the setup page; it does not use email verification.
- Set `MAIL_SESSION_SECRET`, `MAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and SMTP credentials through a secret manager.
- Keep `MAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY` outside the SQLite data volume.
- Set `MAIL_TRUST_PROXY=1` only when direct access to the application port is blocked.
- Back up the database and encryption key separately and protect both at rest.
- Restrict filesystem access to the application user.
- Keep Go, the Go module graph, Node.js build tooling, and npm dependencies current; review `govulncheck` and `npm audit` results.

## Credential exposure

If a mailbox password or refresh token is exposed:

1. Change the mailbox password.
2. Revoke the affected application/session in the Microsoft account security portal.
3. Complete authorization again to obtain a new refresh token.
4. Remove the exposed value from logs, screenshots, issues, commits, and backups where possible.

## Current protections

- Owner-scoped multi-user account access.
- Signed HttpOnly cookies backed by revocable server-side sessions.
- Receive-only isolated guest sessions.
- AES-256-GCM encrypted credential fields.
- Server-side email HTML sanitization, CSS network-load removal, and remote-image proxying with private-network rejection and DNS pinning.
- TLS-only IMAP/SMTP connections, XOAUTH2 authentication, and Microsoft Graph fallback.
- No-store API responses and restrictive browser security headers.
- Per-user/guest external-operation limits and trusted-proxy-aware authentication rate limits.
- Production startup checks for strong secrets.
- One-time administrator bootstrap (no email code) and email-verified registration/password reset with five-minute codes.
